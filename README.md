# CSC401 Practicum - Algorithm Animations  

These are my projects for the CSC401 Practicum at the University of Miami.
The course is designed to be taken alongside CSC317 Algorithms. It is an
introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the goal is to create
animations of algorithms that appear in the lecture course.

The template files provided were old - they used HTML3, did not always close
tags, had scripts inline with several elements, and in general were not up to
speed in terms of usefulness for teaching front end engineering. So, I basically
gutted the entire thing and used Bootstrap for CSS and jQuery for my script.

I did this while learning these tools myself so hopefully the code is on par.

My goal is to have these files used as new templates for the course.

## Resources

The practicum homepage provides some resources for you. Some get too nitty gritty
in plain HTML or JavaScript and some have way more info on things that don't
focus on a quick start. My goal is to get you up and running as quickly as
possible on the most important things. 

As far as the languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript go, you don't need to memorize
them. Just become familiar with them as you use the documentation. 

This is a big one. Avoid writing plain CSS if you can. People use frameworks,
preprocessors, or a combination of both. Frameworks are huge sets of prewritten
classes so instead of styling all the parts of a button you can just say something
like class="button". Preprocessors are essentially extended CSS languages that support
more features, and are compiled into regular CSS.

Bootstrap is a common framework and saves you 80% of workload compared to following
the given instructions.

Two common preprocessors are Sass and Less. Here's Sass.
