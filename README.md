#CSC401 Practicum - Algorithm Animations
##by Devin Michaels

These are my projects for the CSC401 Practicum at the University of Miami.
The course is designed to be taken alongside CSC317 Algorithms. It is an
introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the goal is to create
animations of algorithms that appear in the lecture course.

The template files provided were old - they used HTML3, did not always close
tags, had scripts inline with several elements, and in general were not up to
speed in terms of usefulness for teaching front end engineering. So, I basically
gutted the entire thing and used Bootstrap for CSS and jQuery for my script.

I did this while learning these tools myself so hopefully the code is on par.

My goal is to have these files used as new templates for the course.
